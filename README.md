This program is a verification system for breast milk. This program is meant to be used at the bedside in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

This system uses modules such as Tkinter, os, matplotlib, and MySQL. The user will implement this program at the bedside. Before administering breast milk, the user will use a GUI interface to enter the MRN on the label on the breast milk as well as a second nurse's credentials to verify that the breast milk belongs to the correct patient. If the second nurse's credentials are correct, the user will have the option to view the most recent verification times and verifiers on a graph.
